## Projects
### Finding Employment In BC - BUS 336 Tableau Hackathon
[Tableau Public Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/philemon.lam/viz/Dashboard_17324289633760/Dashboard)

For my BUS336 hackathon, my group chose to create a narrative and Tableau dashboard focused on finding employment in BC. In our team of four, it was my responsibility to create the dashboard. 
I collected and cleaned data from StatsCan, BCStats, and WorkBC. Then, I used Tableau to design a visually appealing dashboard. Judged by industry professionals from EA, StatsCan, and Glentel, my dashboard placed 2nd out of 51.
